# Exploring Tokenization for NLP Purposes


Tokenization is a fundamental step in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is the process of breaking down text into smaller pieces called tokens. In general, tokens can be words, phrases, or even sentences, depending on the level of granularity you need for your task.

For example, consider the sentence: "I love playing football." When tokenized at the word level, the output would be a list of words like ["I", "love", "playing", "football"].

There are two main types of tokenization:
* Word Tokenization: This is the most common form of tokenization. It splits a sentence into individual words. This method is highly effective for languages that use spaces between words, like English. For example, "I love NLP." becomes ["I", "love", "NLP."].
* Sentence Tokenization: Also known as sentence segmentation, it splits a text into individual sentences. This is helpful when the text is long and you want to understand the context at the sentence level. For example, "I love NLP. It's fascinating!" becomes ["I love NLP.", "It's fascinating!"].

Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP because it allows algorithms to manage, understand, and process the text data in a structured format. Once the text is tokenized, further processing like stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal can be applied, and these tokens can then be used for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval.

Here are some examples of Word Tokenization:
* I am a computer science student
| I  | am | a | computer | science | student |
